# Annnimate Starter Pack

16 free components from the Annnimate library, yours to use in any project. No attribution, no expiry. A new one joins the pack every week.

## What's inside

- **text-reveal**: Text comes in word by word or letter by letter as you scroll. Good for hero headlines that need some weight.
  Needs: GSAP, ScrollTrigger, SplitText. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/text-reveal?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **accordion**: A smooth accordion for FAQs and product details. Click a row and it opens with its height animating and the icon flipping, and the text can reveal line by line. Set it to one open at a time or several.
  Needs: GSAP, SplitText. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/accordion?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **dual-scramble**: Text scrambles through a brand colour and then settles into its final colour. Fire it on scroll, hover, click or load. No layout shift, and screen readers still get the real words.
  Needs: GSAP, ScrambleTextPlugin, ScrollTrigger. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/dual-scramble?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **multi-level-drawer-menu**: A drawer menu with two panels. The first slides in, and if a category has sub-links, hovering it opens a second panel next to it. The page behind dims while the menu stays clickable, and on phones it turns into a tap-through drill-down.
  Needs: GSAP. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/multi-level-drawer-menu?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **image-fly-in**: Imagery continuously flies in from deep inside the page toward the viewer, fading in and out around a central zone that stays clear for your content. The whole field glides softly with your cursor.
  Needs: GSAP, ScrollTrigger, SplitText, CustomEase. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/image-fly-in?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **scale-slider**: A row of square photos that shrink away toward one edge, with the biggest one cropped right off the screen. Drag it, throw it, scroll the page, or let it drift on its own.
  Needs: GSAP, Draggable, InertiaPlugin, CustomEase. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/scale-slider?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **curtain-slider**: A full-bleed image slider where each slide change plays a staggered curtain: the outgoing image is divided into twelve columns and each column's clip edge wipes sideways one after another, revealing the next image settling into place beneath. Title, chapter label, and index roll between slides, with arrow, drag, and keyboard navigation built in.
  Needs: GSAP, CustomEase. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/curtain-slider?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **feature-dialog**: A preview tile with an expand button that opens a tall centered dialog - the page dims and blurs behind it, the dialog rises in with a fast fade, and a gradient band follows it up. Focus, Escape and the backdrop are all wired up.
  Needs: GSAP, CustomEase. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/feature-dialog?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **ascii-overlay**: Data-styled characters bloom over a real photo or video as you scroll, tinted to the colours underneath and only appearing in the brighter areas. The photo itself never disappears - unlike ASCII effects that replace the image with characters entirely, this one only adds to it.
  Needs: GSAP, three, ScrollTrigger. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/ascii-overlay?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **pricing**: A pricing section with a monthly/yearly switch. Flip it and every price rolls to its new number digit by digit and a savings chip pops in, while each plan name carries a constant shimmer.
  Needs: GSAP, CustomEase. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/pricing?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **split-flap-board**: A mechanical split-flap board, the kind that hangs in stations. Click it and every tile riffles through its flaps to the next result, rows cascading left to right, each tile landing on its own beat like a real drum.
  Needs: GSAP, CustomEase. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/split-flap-board?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **process-rail**: A row of steps along a line. As you scroll, a small bead draws the line behind it and each step lights up as the bead reaches it, its number rolling in and its image fading in underneath and staying. For how-it-works, onboarding and process sections.
  Needs: GSAP, ScrollTrigger, MotionPathPlugin, DrawSVGPlugin, CustomEase. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/process-rail?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **elastic-divider**: A section divider with some life in it. It is one thin line between two sections, and when the cursor sweeps across it the line springs away and rings back to rest like a guitar string, harder the faster you go. Nothing moves on scroll and nothing moves on its own.
  Needs: GSAP. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/elastic-divider?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **magnetic-tag-cloud**: A pack of colourful tags in the middle of the page. Sweep the mouse through them and they get knocked outward, tilting as they bump into each other, harder the faster you move. Then every tag is pulled back to its own spot like a magnet. There is no gravity and no pile: the cloud always tidies itself back up.
  Needs: GSAP, Draggable, CustomEase. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/magnetic-tag-cloud?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **rotating-words**: A list of words on a turning wheel: the word in the middle stands out while the rest fade away above and below. Turn it with the scroll, or let it spin through the list and land on the last word.
  Needs: GSAP, ScrollTrigger, CustomEase. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/rotating-words?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery
- **echo-headline**: A one-word headline that grows a 3D slab of its own copies as you scroll, stacking out on top into a trail of echoes that fade with depth. Tip, turn or tilt it with the X, Y and Z angles.
  Needs: GSAP, ScrollTrigger. All options: https://annnimate.com/animations/echo-headline?utm_source=starter-pack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-delivery

## What's in each folder

- `preview.mp4`: a short video of the component in action, so you can see how it looks before you paste it anywhere.
- `example.jsx` and `example.vue`: a working example that imports the component and renders it with real content. Start here.
- `{slug}.jsx`: the React component. It imports its own stylesheet, `{slug}.css`, so keep the two files side by side.
- `{slug}.vue`: the Vue 3 component.
- `{slug}.html`, `{slug}.css` and `{slug}.js`: the plain HTML version.

## Install GSAP

Every component runs on GSAP, which is free, plugins included. Plugins like ScrollTrigger and SplitText ship inside the `gsap` package, there's nothing extra to install.

```bash
# React or Next.js
npm install gsap @gsap/react

# Vue or Nuxt
npm install gsap
```

If a component's "Needs" line above lists three, also run `npm install three`.

## Use a component in React or Next.js

You don't write any GSAP code yourself. Each component registers the plugins it needs and cleans up after itself.

1. Copy the component's folder into your project, for example `components/annnimate/text-reveal/`.
2. Import the component and render it. `example.jsx` in the same folder shows the markup and props it expects.

```jsx
import TextReveal from "@/components/annnimate/text-reveal/text-reveal";
```

Every component file starts with `"use client"`, so in the Next.js App Router you can render it from a server page as it is.

## Use a component in Vue or Nuxt

1. Copy the component's folder into your project.
2. Import the component and its stylesheet where you use it. `example.vue` shows both lines.

```js
import TextReveal from "./annnimate/text-reveal/text-reveal.vue";
import "./annnimate/text-reveal/text-reveal.css";
```

## Use a component in plain HTML

1. Paste the markup from `text-reveal.html` where you want it.
2. Link `text-reveal.css` in your `<head>`.
3. Before `</body>`, load GSAP, then each plugin from the component's "Needs" line, then the component's script.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3/dist/gsap.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3/dist/ScrollTrigger.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3/dist/SplitText.min.js"></script>
<script src="text-reveal.js"></script>
```

Every plugin lives at the same kind of path: `gsap@3/dist/ScrollTrigger.min.js`, `gsap@3/dist/CustomEase.min.js` and so on.

## Change how it moves

- React and Vue: pass props. The names and defaults sit at the top of the component file.
- HTML: set `data-anm-*` attributes on the element, for example `data-anm-duration="0.8"`.

Each component's page lists every option with its default, and lets you tune it live before you copy.

## The rest of the library

The full library has 120+ components, with a new one every week, in HTML, React and Vue.
